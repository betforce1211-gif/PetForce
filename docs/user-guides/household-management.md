## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid Invite Code" Error

**Causes:**
- Typo in code entry
- Code expired (30 days old)
- Code was regenerated by leader

**Solution:**
1. **Double-check spelling** (codes are UPPERCASE)
2. **Ask leader** to share code again or regenerate
3. **Try QR code** or email invite method instead

### "Already in a Household" Error

**Cause:** You're already a member of another household

**Solution:**
1. **Leave current household** first
2. **Then join new household**

**Note:** Phase 1 limits users to 1 household. Multi-household support coming in Phase 2!

### "Household at Capacity" Error

**Cause:** Household has reached 15-member limit

**Solution:**
1. **Ask leader** to remove inactive members
2. **Or create a new household** and invite active members

## Best Practices

### For Leaders

1. **Choose clear household names** (e.g., "Smith Family Pets" not "House123")
2. **Add description** with pet count for context
3. **Review requests promptly** (< 24 hours ideal)
4. **Use temporary access** for pet sitters (don't leave them as permanent)
5. **Regenerate codes quarterly** for security

### For All Members

1. **Enable push notifications** for instant updates
2. **Don't share invite codes** publicly or on social media
3. **Update your profile** with clear name/photo (helps leader identify you)
4. **Communicate** with household before joining (avoid surprise requests)
