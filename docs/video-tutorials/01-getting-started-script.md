### [0:00 - Opening]
"Welcome to PetForce! In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create your first household and invite your family."

### [0:15 - Why Households?]
"Households let you collaborate with family members on pet care. Think of it as a digital version of your home - everyone who lives there can track feeding, medications, and vet appointments together."

**Screen**: Example household "The Smith House" with 3 members, 2 dogs

### [0:45 - Creating Your Household]
"After registering, click 'Create a Household'. Give it a name - like your last name or a fun family name."

**Screen**: Demo creating "The Zeder House"

"Add a description to help others know what to expect: '2 dogs, 3 cats, 1 bird'."

### [1:30 - Understanding Invite Codes]
"Your household gets a unique invite code - like ZEDER-ALPHA-BRAVO. This is how you invite family!"

**Screen**: Show invite code prominently

"You can share this code 3 ways:
1. Copy and paste it (tap to copy)
2. Show a QR code (tap the QR button)
3. Send an email invite (tap the email button)"

### [2:15 - Inviting Your First Member]
**Screen**: Show mobile app scanning QR code

"Family members just need to:
1. Download PetForce
2. Register
3. Enter your invite code or scan the QR code
4. Wait for your approval"

### [2:45 - Approving Members]
**Screen**: Show pending request notification

"When someone requests to join, you'll get a notification. Tap 'Approve' and they're in!"
