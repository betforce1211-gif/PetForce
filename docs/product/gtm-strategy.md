## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Low Activation
**Risk**: Users sign up but don't create household
**Mitigation**: Onboarding flow, email drips, in-app prompts

### Risk 2: Low Multi-Member Adoption
**Risk**: Households stay single-member
**Mitigation**: "Invite family" prompts, referral incentives, viral QR codes

### Risk 3: Paid Ads Don't Convert
**Risk**: CPA >$10, unsustainable
**Mitigation**: A/B test creative, optimize landing page, retargeting

### Risk 4: Press Doesn't Cover Us
**Risk**: No press mentions, low organic traffic
**Mitigation**: Hire PR firm, personal outreach, exclusive demos
