## Common Questions

### "This email is already registered"

If you see this message, it means you already have a PetForce account with that email.

**What to do:**

1. **Try signing in instead**
   - Click the "Sign in" button in the message
   - Use your existing password
   - Welcome back!

2. **Forgot your password?**
   - Click "Reset password"
   - We'll email you a link to create a new one
   - Check your inbox and follow the link

3. **Not sure if you have an account?**
   - Try the "Forgot password" flow
   - We'll only send an email if you have an account
   - If you don't get an email, try registering again

### "Password too weak"

Your password needs to be strong to protect your pet's information.

**How to make it stronger:**

- ✅ Use at least 8 characters
- ✅ Mix uppercase and lowercase letters
- ✅ Add numbers
- ✅ Include symbols (!, @, #, $, etc.)

**Good passwords:**
- `BuddyLoves2024!`
- `C@tMom4Ever`
- `MyPet$2026`

**Weak passwords:**
- `password` (too common)
- `12345678` (too simple)
- `buddy` (too short)

### "Passwords don't match"

This means the password and confirm password fields are different.

**How to fix:**
1. Carefully type your password in the first field
2. Type the exact same password in the "Confirm" field
3. They need to match exactly (watch for capital letters!)

### "Check your email"

After creating your account, you need to verify your email address.

**What happens:**
1. We send you a verification email
2. Click the link in that email
3. Your account becomes active
4. You can sign in and use PetForce

**If you don't see the email:**
- Wait a few minutes (it can take up to 5 minutes)
- Check your spam/junk folder
- Make sure you entered the right email address
- Click "Resend verification email"

### "Too many attempts"

If you try to register too many times, we temporarily block new attempts.

**Why we do this:**
- Protects your account from bad actors
- Keeps PetForce secure for all pet parents

**What to do:**
- Wait 30 minutes
- Try again
- If it still doesn't work, contact support
